While implementing the software, we have mostly stayed close to the algorithms described by Patel in \cite{redblob}.

The most important difference between our implementation and the demo implementation as given by Patel is that we have split up generation and visualisation.
This allows us to have a graphics-light generation application that is focused solely on enabling the user to tweak parameters and come up with a good terrain, while having a more immersive visualisation environment where a user can explore the terrain in more detail.
