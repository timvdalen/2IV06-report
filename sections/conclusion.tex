%conclusion and future work

In conclusion, we have implemented the basic terrain generation algorithm and an application that can import and visualise the generated terrain.

Since the visualiser has less features than originally planned, that is the main focus for future work.
The next steps for the visualiser are better interactivity (including walking, flying, generally moving around) and making the biomes look nicer.
While biomes are already assigned by the generator, they are currently shown by a single plain color, while adding a texture would already make them look much better.
A possible next step for biomes is adding vegetation and wildlife.
