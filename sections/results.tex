%results & evaluation, explicitly mentioning of known limitations

So far, we are able to fully generate terrains, including elevations, biomes and rivers.
Figure~\ref{fig:generator} shows a generated map.

	\caption{There are cases where rivers can be visualised without standing out, however many of the generated maps will contain small polygons that lead to unpredictable geometric river representations. It would take a significant amount of time to improve the current method.}

We have also started work on the viewer, although that is not yet as interactive as it should be.
